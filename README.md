# RETAIL SALES ANALYTICS

## Project Overview

This project involved the design and implementation of an end-to-end Oracle retail analytics database that models real-world retail operations
across four stores selling **food, electronics, furniture, and clothing**. The system integrates **customer, sales, store, and product** data using 
fully normalized relational schemas and ER diagrams, with documented business assumptions to ensure accuracy, consistency, and scalability.


The project emphasizes advanced data analytics and automation through **SQL**. It includes complex SQL views for analyzing 
**customer lifetime value, store performance, sales trends, and product category revenue**, as well as PL/SQL triggers to enforce business
rules such as **automatic sales calculations, data validation, and audit logging**. Stored procedures and packages manage transactional inserts,
discount logic, and monthly sales rollups, while performance is optimized using indexes and analytic functions like RANK, SUM OVER, and LAG 
to support efficient, production-ready reporting.
